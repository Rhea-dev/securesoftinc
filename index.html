    <h2>How Will Man Eventually Die?</h2>
    <p>People only how they were brought into the world but nobody knows what way he or she would leave the world. It is quite understandable that nobody has ever really sat down and fantasiz on how they would die because yeah, who wants to leave the world no matter how bad and crooked we are all just looking for ways to hold on to life. The bitter truth of the matter is <b>Something must kill a man</b> be it money, woman, power or anything a man must die one way or the other. </p>
